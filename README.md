# 🏆 Sibling Code Smackdown: There Can Be Only One (Winner, Me) 🏆

Welcome to the digital arena where a classic sibling rivalry gets a modern upgrade, swapping petty arguments for performance benchmarks: **LeetCode.** This is not just code; this is war... The battlefield might be digital now, but the objective remains the same: total domination

## 🔥 The Gauntlet Has Been Thrown

This repository tracks the *real* test of superiority between me and dada. We're battling for:

-   Sheer volume of problems crushed.
-   Points for tackling brain-meltingly Hard challenges.
-   Code so clean, it practically sparkles (or at least passes the linter).
-   **ULTIMATE. ETERNAL. BRAGGING. RIGHTS.** (The only prize that truly matters).

## 📊 The Glorious (and Accurate) Scoreboard

Witness the carnage in real-time. Gaze upon the scoreboard and know the truth:
[Sibling LeetCode Battle Scoreboard](#) **(A Public Service Announcement for my dear brother, Dada:** While you're busy admiring this README, my score is likely climbing. Less reading, more coding! Chop chop!)

## 🥇 The Arbitrary (But Fiercely Contested) Points System

-   Easy Problem: 1 point (Basically a participation trophy)
-   Medium Problem: 3 points (Respectable, I guess)
-   Hard Problem: 5 points (Proof of actual brainpower)
-   Optimal Solution Bonus: +1 point (Subject to intense peer review, aka arguing if it *really* counts)

## 🗂️ Organized Chaos: Repository Structure

Even in the heat of battle, we maintain *some* decorum. Solutions follow this sacred format:
`[Difficulty] Problem Name`

Example: `[Easy] Two Sum`
(So even in defeat, your code *looks* organized.)

## 💬 Fueling the Family Feud

This repo serves as immutable proof for future "discussions" (read: arguments) at family gatherings about who *really* got the brains. Perfect for derailing pleasant dinners with irrefutable evidence of coding supremacy.

Dada's current radio silence? Could be fear. Could be intense focus. Could be he accidentally pushed his local `.env` file. The mystery continues...

## 🏁 The Alleged "Final Goal"

Sure, they say the *real* victory is becoming better programmers together... yada yada yada... improving our skills... blah blah blah...
Let's be honest: it's about the glorious, undeniable **WIN**. (And maybe getting slightly better at coding on the side).

## ⚠️ WARNING: Side Effects May Include...

Engaging in this high-stakes battle may lead to:

-   Wild gesticulation while explaining algorithms to Aie or Baba.
-   Attempting to resolve family disputes with `git merge`.
-   Developing an unhealthy attachment to your IDE's theme.
-   Dreaming in linked lists.
-   Whispering "Time complexity..." ominously during movie nights.
-   An existential crisis when faced with a DP Hard problem at 2 AM.

## 👨‍💻 How to Qualify (Good Luck)

1.  Possess matching genetic markers (or be officially adopted into the madness).
2.  Accept that second place isn't *so* bad (advice for my brother).
3.  Clone this repo (if you dare).
4.  Solve a problem (try not to cry).
5.  Commit with the sacred format.
6.  Update the scoreboard (truthfully... mostly).
7.  Prepare your victory speech (or concession speech, depending on your name).
